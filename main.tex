			\item Open the {\bf Project Report Template.tex} file and carefully follow the comments (starting with \%).
			\item Process the file with {\bf pdflatex}, using other processors may need you to change some features such as graphics types.
			\item Note the files included in the  {\bf Project Report Template.tex} (with the .tex extension excluded). You can open these files separately and modify their contents 
			or create new ones.
			\item Contact the latex namual for more features in your document such as equations, subfigures, footnotes, subscripts \& superscripts, special characters etc.
			\item I recommend using the {\bf kile} latex IDE, as it is simple to use.
